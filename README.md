Files numbered from 1 to 3.1 contain the implementation of the model for each dataset:

SBM implementation for the simulated dataset
1.1 Hierarchical model implementation for the simulated dataset
SBM implementation for the Karate dataset
2.1 Hierarchical model implementation for the Karate dataset
SBM implementation for the Macaque dataset
3.1 Hierarchical model implementation for the Macaque dataset
The Multilevel Stochastic Block Model folder contains the main implementation and construction of the hierarchical model, while the Stochastic Block Model folder contains the main implementation and construction of the SBM.

There are also three datasets included, which are required to run the code.
