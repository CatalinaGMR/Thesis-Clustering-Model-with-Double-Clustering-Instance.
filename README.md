Numbering from 1 to 3.1 refers to the files containing the implementation of the model for each dataset. File 1 is the implementation of the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) for the simulated dataset, while file 1.1 is the implementation of the hierarchical model for the same simulated dataset. File 2 contains the SBM implementation for the Karate dataset, and file 2.1 contains the hierarchical model implementation for that dataset. File 3 includes the SBM implementation for the Macaque dataset, and file 3.1 contains the hierarchical model implementation for the Macaque dataset.

The Multilevel Stochastic Block Model directory includes the main implementation and construction of the hierarchical model, while the Stochastic Block Model directory includes the main implementation and construction of the SBM. Additionally, the three datasets used to run the code are also included.
